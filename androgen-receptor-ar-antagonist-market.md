<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Androgen Receptor (AR) Antagonist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steroidal AR Antagonists</li><li>Nonsteroidal AR Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The androgen receptor (AR) antagonist market is divided into two main types: steroidal and nonsteroidal AR antagonists. Steroidal AR antagonists are derived from steroid hormones and typically mimic their structure, affecting hormone receptor activity. Nonsteroidal AR antagonists, on the other hand, do not share the steroid structure and often exhibit different mechanisms of action. Both types are utilized primarily in the treatment of conditions like prostate cancer, where blocking androgen activity can impede tumor growth and progression.</p></p>
