<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The luminous Pigment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Luminous Coatings</li><li>Fluorescent Coatings</li><li>Phosphorescent Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The luminous pigment market encompasses three main types: self-luminous coatings, fluorescent coatings, and phosphorescent coatings. Self-luminous coatings generate light without an external energy source, often using radioactive materials. Fluorescent coatings absorb light and re-emit it almost instantly, creating vibrant colors under UV light. Phosphorescent coatings also absorb light but store it for a longer duration, emitting a glow after the light source is removed. Each type serves distinct applications ranging from safety signage to decorative elements in various industries.</p></p>
