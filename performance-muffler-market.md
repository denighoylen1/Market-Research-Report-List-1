<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Performance Muffler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorptive Mufflers</li><li>Reactive Mufflers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The performance muffler market is primarily divided into two types: absorptive mufflers and reactive mufflers. Absorptive mufflers use sound-absorbing materials to reduce noise levels by dissipating sound energy, providing a quieter exhaust system while enhancing performance. Reactive mufflers, on the other hand, utilize chambers and bends to reflect sound waves, canceling out specific frequencies and maintaining a sporty exhaust note. Both types aim to improve engine efficiency and performance while optimizing sound characteristics in vehicles.</p></p>
