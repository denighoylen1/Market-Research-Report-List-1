<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sleep Apnoea Treatment Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP</li><li>BiPAP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sleep apnea treatment devices market primarily features Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) devices. CPAP delivers a constant airflow to keep the airway open during sleep, making it the most common treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. BiPAP, on the other hand, offers two pressure settingsâ€”one for inhalation and a lower one for exhalation, providing more comfort for patients with complex or severe sleep apnea. Both devices improve sleep quality and overall health.</p></p>
