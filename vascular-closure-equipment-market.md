<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Closure Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Approximators</li><li>Passive Approximators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vascular closure equipment market is categorized into two main types: active approximators and passive approximators. Active approximators utilize mechanical devices to actively close puncture sites by applying controlled pressure or suturing mechanisms. Conversely, passive approximators rely on natural physiological processes or materials, such as collagen plugs or sealants, to facilitate closure without direct mechanical intervention. Both types aim to enhance patient safety, reduce bleeding complications, and expedite recovery following vascular procedures, catering to varying clinical needs and preferences.</p></p>
